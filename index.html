<h2>About Us</h2>
	<p>In 2019, Owner, Maddy Krueger, adopted two lovable cats, later naming them Orion and Venus. Their spunk and love for people was their most adorable features she fell in love with and soon saw them as her stars. In 2020, Dipper was adopted and made a purrfect additon to our growing family. After years of support from all of you on Tiktok, we opened our cafe officially in 2022. We serve hot or cold drinks with scrumptus snacks to crave your every appetite! So join us to enjoy the best coffee for humankind. </p>
